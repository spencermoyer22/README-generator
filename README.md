# README Generator

## Description
This program uses the Node.js file system and the npm Inquirer. It takes user input prompted through the command line and uses that
information to transfer the data gathered to create a professional README.md file. The prompts are created through the Inquirer npm. 
A template for the README is created in a function that takes the input from the prompts to fill out the template. The template from
that function is then used in a writeFile function using the file system to create the file in a directory titled dist.

## Installation
To install this program, clone the repository. Once you have the files open in your IDE, open a terminal and run the command `npm i`.
This will install the necessary npm packages, which in this case is Inquirer. If you do you not have Node.js already downloaded, you 
must first download this.

## Usage
After the program is successfully installed, follow this link to watch a short video on how to run the program through your terminal.
